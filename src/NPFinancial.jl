is compounded once per period, over `nper` number of periods. A fixed payment `pmt`
may be specified in the `when` argument, which is paid either at the beginning of
each period (`:begin`) or `:end` of the period.

Compute the payment given the present value `pv`, an interest rate `rate` that

end of the last period the value becomes `fv`. The payment is expected to be paid
at the beginning of each period (`:begin`) or `:end` of the period, as specified

    rate(nper::Integer, pmt::Real, pv::Real, fv::Real, when=:end, guess=0.1, tol=1e-6, maxiter=100)

Compute interest rate given present value `pv`, future value `fv`, and fixed periodic
payment `pmt` over a number of periods `nper`.

This implementation uses Newton's iteration until the change is less than 1e-6.
Newton's rule is

``r_{n+1} = r_{n} - \\frac{g(r_n)}{g'(r_n)}``

where
* g(r) is the formula
* g'(r) is the derivative with respect to r.

    npv(rate::Real, values::AbstractVector{<:Real})

Compute the Net Present Value (NPV) of a cash flow series `values` given
an internal rate of return `rate`.

The (fixed) time interval between cash flow "events" must be the same as that for
which `rate` is given (i.e., if `rate` is per year, then precisely
a year is understood to elapse between each cash flow event).  By
convention, investments or "deposits" are negative, income or
"withdrawals" are positive; `values` must begin with the initial
investment, thus `values[1]` will typically be negative.
